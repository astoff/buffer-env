;;; Commentary:

;; The purpose of this package is to adjust the `process-environment'
;; and `exec-path' variables buffer locally according to the output of
;; a shell script.  This allows the correct operation of tools such as
;; linters, compilers and language servers when working on projects
;; with special requirements which are not installed globally on the
;; system.

;; The default settings of this package are compatible with the
;; popular direnv program.  However, the package is entirely
;; independent of direnv and it's not possible to use direnv-specific
;; features in the .envrc scripts.  On the plus side, it's possible to
;; configure the package to support other environment setup methods,
;; such as .env files or Python virtualenvs.  The README file includes
;; some examples.

;; The usual way to activate this package is by including the
;; following in your init file:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook 'buffer-env-update)
;;
;; In this way, any buffer potentially affected by directory-local
;; variables will also be affected by buffer-env.  It is nonetheless
;; possible to call `buffer-env-update' interactively or add it only
;; to specific major-mode hooks.
